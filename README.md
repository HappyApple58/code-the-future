hello! this is my README file. This is my first website and I decided to make a website to help me study and get work done by being a hub full of links to useful sites as well as study tips and motivation.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Active recal</h3>
  <p>
    Active recal is a study technique that involves actually trying to remember information in order to strengthen your memory of it. Instead of passively reading or highlighting text, you actively englage with the material by repeatedly testing yourself. This helps improve your ability to retrieve information from memory.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Spaced repetition</h3>
  <p>
    Spaced repetition is a study technique that involves reviewing material (preferably through active recal) at increasing intervals in order to improve your long-term retention of information and combat the forgetting curve. Apps and websites like Anki can help you implenment spaced repetition by automating the process of scheduling reviews.)

  <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">Blurting</h3>
  <p>
    Blurting is a study technique that involves writing down everything you know about a topic from memory, without looking at your notes or textbooks. This helps you identify gaps in your knowledge and reinforce what you already know. After blurting, you can review your notes to fill in any missing information. This technique is esspecially useful for connectinng concepts and improving overall understanding of material.

  <h3 style="margin-top: 40px;">The Feynman Technique</h3>
  <p>
    Based off of the idea that if you want to understand something well, you must be able to explain it simply, the Feynman Technique involves teaching another person (or even an imaginary person out loud)
